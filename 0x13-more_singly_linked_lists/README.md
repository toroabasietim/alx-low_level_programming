### ALX Linked lists project
***
This project affirms my understanding of Linked lists and data structures in general. <br>
The tasks here show that I have a good grasp of how to:
* Decide on when to choose a singly linked list over other data structures
* Calculate the Big O notation of certain operations, and use it to make informed decisions in my choice of data structures
* Create a singly linked list
* Insert a node at the beginning of a singly linked list
* Traverse a singly linked list
* Insert a node at the end of a singly linked list
* Delete a node from the end of a singly linked list
* Delete a node at a certain position in a singly linked list
